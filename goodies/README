The StaribusTimeRecoveryTool needs to have the python 2.6 programming language installed to work.

To use the tool set Enable.Debug.Staribus=true in loader.properties.

Attempt to download your data using Starbase, move the resulting Starbase.log file located in
INSTALL_PATH/logs into the folder in which you found this program.

run python StaribusTimeRecoveryTool -h for a full list of options.

Example for VLF data
--------------------

run the StaribusTimeRecoveryTool like so from a command line.

python StaribusTimeRecoveryTool starbase.log vlf mydata.csv

If recover is successful you should get a csv file with
the recovered data.
