Some of these sample test files have deliberate errors in the format
in order to test Starbase error handling.
So don't be alarmed if you see error messages in the console/DOS window
or in the Starbase EventLog, that's meant to happen!
The purpose of adding these errors is to make sure that the import parsers
can cope in a sensible way.
