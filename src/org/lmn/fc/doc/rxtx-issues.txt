Hello Martin,
   We found that we had to get a fresh CommPortIdentifier each time -
reusing the previous one, even though the port had been closed,
caused this to barf.

while (true) {
	portId=CommPortIdentifier.getPortIdentifier(pName);
	Thread.sleep(2000); // or else USB dongles barf
     serialport = (SerialPort) portId.open("MyApp",100);
	// do something interesting
     serialport.close();
}

Previously, we just tried to do
serialport = (SerialPort) portId.open("MyApp,100);
or
SerialPort serialport2 = ...

a second time, but that gave the so-called PortInUseException.

We're now limping along.  Still struggling with USB-dongles - seems
to need a full 2s after insertion to reliably be able to open the
serial port.

This was a problem on OSX and WinXPSP2 both.  We downloaded the
"2.1-8" (which reports itself as 2.1-7) from CSV - it helped on the
OSX side as it stopped flooding the console with irrelevant locking
warnings.  Other than that, we saw no change in behaviour.

Cheers,
greg
