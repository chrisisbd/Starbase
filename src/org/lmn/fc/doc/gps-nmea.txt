$GPAPB

Autopilot format "B"

This sentence is sent by some GPS receivers to allow them to be used to control an autopilot dmsformat. This sentence is commonly used by autopilots and contains navigation receiver warning flag status, cross-track-error, waypoint arrival status, initial bearing from origin waypoint to the destination, continuous bearing from present position to destination and recommended heading-to-steer to destination waypoint for the active navigation leg of the journey.

Note: Some autopilots, Robertson in particular, misinterpret "bearing from origin to destination" as "bearing from present position to destination". This is likely due to the difference between the APB sentence and the APA sentence. for the APA sentence this would be the correct thing to do for the data in the same field. APA only differs from APB in this one field and APA leaves off the last two fields where this distinction is clearly spelled out. This will result in poor performance if the boat is sufficiently off-course that the two bearings are different.

  $GPAPB,A,A,0.10,R,N,V,V,011,M,DEST,011,M,011,M*82

where:
    APB     Autopilot format B
    A       Loran-C blink/SNR warning, general warning
    A       Loran-C cycle warning
    0.10    cross-track error distance
    R       steer Right to correct (or L for Left)
    N       cross-track error units - nautical miles (K for kilometers)
    V       arrival alarm - circle
    V       arrival alarm - perpendicular
    011,M   magnetic bearing, origin to destination
    DEST    destination waypoint ID
    011,M   magnetic bearing, present position to destination
    011,M   magnetic heading to steer (bearings could True as 033,T)

$GPBOD

Bearing Origin to Destination

eg.  BOD,045.,T,023.,M,DEST,START
           045.,T       bearing 045 degrees True from "START" to "DEST"
           023.,M       breaing 023 degrees Magnetic from "START" to "DEST"
           DEST         destination waypoint ID
           START        origin waypoint ID

Example 1: $GPBOD,099.3,T,105.6,M,POINTB,*01
Waypoint ID: "POINTB" Bearing 99.3 True, 105.6 Magnetic
This sentence is transmitted in the GOTO mode, without an active route on your GPS. WARNING: this is the bearing from the moment you press enter in the GOTO page to the destination waypoint and is NOT updated dynamically! To update the information, (current bearing to waypoint), you will have to press enter in the GOTO page again.

Example 2: $GPBOD,097.0,T,103.2,M,POINTB,POINTA*52
This sentence is transmitted when a route is active. It contains the active leg information: origin waypoint "POINTA" and destination waypoint "POINTB", bearing between the two points 97.0 True, 103.2 Magnetic. It does NOT display the bearing from current location to destination waypoint! WARNING Again this information does not change until you are on the next leg of the route. (The bearing from POINTA to POINTB does not change during the time you are on this leg.)

Format of latitudes and longitudes

Where a numeric latitude or longitude is given, the two digits immediately to the left of the decimal point are whole minutes, to the right are decimals of minutes, and the remaining digits to the left of the whole minutes are whole degrees.

eg. 4533.35 is 45 degrees and 33.35 minutes. ".35" of a minute is exactly 21 seconds.

eg. 16708.033 is 167 degrees and 8.033 minutes. ".033" of a minute is about 2 seconds.
