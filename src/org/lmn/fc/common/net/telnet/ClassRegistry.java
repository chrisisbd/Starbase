/* The Class Registry.

   This class should never be instantiated.  Instead, it is used by
   calling the static methods of the class, to register objects with
   it and send messages to the currently registered objects.

   Because the methods and data are static, they are shared between
   all objects that use the class: thus an object in one applet or
   document can "see" the objects registered by another.

   Note that, for this to work, your objects must all be accessing the
   same *class*: i.e., they must use the registry at the same URL.  The
   practical implication of this is that the applets that wish to
   communcate with each should be stored in the same directory on your
   server, along with the ClassRegistry classes themselves.
