A formal EBNF (extended Bachus-Naur Form) where "," denotes the separation character.

CSV file
--------
file         ::= [ header ] { line }
header       ::= [ { entry separator } entry ] newline
line         ::= [ { entry separator } entry ] newline
entry        ::= character+ | { character* " separator " } | " entry newline entry "
newline      ::= \n
separator    ::= ,
character    ::= a|b|..|A|B|..|0|1|..
escapedQuote ::= ""

Or more informally..

    * Entities are separated by new line characters

    * Entries of an entity are separated by a separation character, often a comma (",")
        excluding the the last element of a line

    * An entry may contain the separation character in which case that character is enclosed in quotes

    * An entry may contain newlines in which case the whole entry is enclosed in quotation marks

    * The first line of the file may contain the header descriptions for the columns of the file,
        and may be ignored (or as in the case of Super Csv be utilized when reading data into maps or beans.

    * Any white-spaces at the start of a line, just after the separation character,
        just before a separation character, or just before a newline character is ignored.

    * An escaped quote is two consecutive quote characters.
        The only exception to this rule is when the first character in a cell is a quote it
        always denotes a quote for the form " entry newline entry ".
        Hence the entry "" (double quote in a cell) denotes the empty string, whereas the input """" denotes the string "

CSV is a delimited data format that has fields/columns separated by the comma character
and records/rows separated by newlines. Fields that contain a special character (comma, newline, or double quote),
must be enclosed in double quotes. However, if a line contains a single entry which is the empty string,
it may be enclosed in double quotes. If a field's value contains a double quote character
it is escaped by placing another double quote character next to it.
The CSV file format does not require a specific character encoding, byte order, or line terminator format.

    * Each record is one line terminated by a line feed (ASCII/LF=0x0A) or a carriage return and
    line feed pair (ASCII/CRLF=0x0D 0x0A), however, line-breaks can be embedded.
    * Fields are separated by commas (although in locales where the comma is used as a decimal point,
    the semicolon is used instead as a delimiter, inducing some drawbacks when CSV files are exchanged
    e.g. between France and USA)

1997,Ford,E350

    * In some CSV implementations, leading and trailing spaces or tabs, adjacent to commas, are trimmed.
    This practice is contentious and in fact is specifically prohibited by RFC 4180, which states,
    "Spaces are considered part of a field and should not be ignored."

1997,   Ford   , E350
not same as
1997,Ford,E350

    * Fields with embedded commas must be enclosed within double-quote characters.

1997,Ford,E350,"Super, luxurious truck"

    * Fields with embedded double-quote characters must be enclosed within double-quote characters, and each of the embedded double-quote characters must be represented by a pair of double-quote characters.

1997,Ford,E350,"Super ""luxurious"" truck"

    * Fields with embedded line breaks must be enclosed within double-quote characters.

1997,Ford,E350,"Go get one now
they are going fast"

    * Fields with leading or trailing spaces must be enclosed within double-quote characters.
    (See comment about leading and trailing spaces above.)

1997,Ford,E350,"  Super luxurious truck    "

    * Fields may always be enclosed within double-quote characters, whether necessary or not.

"1997","Ford","E350"

    * The first record in a csv file may contain column names in each of the fields.

[edit] Example
1997 	Ford 	E350 	ac, abs, moon 	3000.00
1999 	Chevy 	Venture "Extended Edition" 	  	4900.00
1999 	Chevy 	Venture "Extended Edition, Very Large" 	  	5000.00
1996 	Jeep 	Grand Cherokee 	MUST SELL!
air, moon roof, loaded 	4799.00

The above table of data may be represented in CSV format as follows:

1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition, Very Large""","",5000.00
1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL!
air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00

This CSV example illustrates that:

    * fields that contain commas, double-quotes, or line-breaks must be quoted.
    * a quote within a field must be escaped with an additional quote immediately preceding the literal quote.
    * a quote and a comma within a field must be escaped with an extra additional quote preceding the literal quote.
    * space before and after delimiter commas may not be trimmed. This is required by RFC 4180.
    * a line break within an element must be preserved.
