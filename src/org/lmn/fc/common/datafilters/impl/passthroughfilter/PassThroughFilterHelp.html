<h3>Pass Through Filter</h3>

<p>The Pass Through Filter copies the RawData directly to the ProcessedData, without any modifications.
    <br>
    <br>Mathematically, for each dataset type;
    <br>
    <br>Timestamped
    <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(t,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;-->&nbsp;(t,&nbsp;y)</b>
    <br>
    <br>Indexed
    <br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x,&nbsp;y)&nbsp;-->&nbsp;(x,&nbsp;y)</b>
    <br>
    <br>This filter is set as the default choice, because in most cases you will probably want to examine the RawData as they were recorded,
    at least initially. When you know what processing is necessary, simply re-import using a different filter. Alternatively, use this command:
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font face="courier">DataProcessor.applyFilter()</font></b>
    <br><br>which will allow repeated transformations without the need to import the data again. You may also transform the ProcessedData repeatedly,
    without re-reading the RawData.
