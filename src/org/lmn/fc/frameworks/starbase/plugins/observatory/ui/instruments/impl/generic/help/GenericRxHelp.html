<title>Starbase Generic Receiver</title>
<body>
<h3>Starbase Generic Receiver</h3>
<br>
<br>The Generic Receiver Instrument can read a file on the PC, using <b>importRawDataLocal()</b>
<br>
<br>You can also retrieve a file from a remote FTP server, using <b>importRawDataRemote()</b>
<br>
<br>...and even a file from a remote FTP server using the REST command, using <b>importRawDataRemoteIncrement()</b>
<br>This command retrieves only the latest data, and appends to the data already downloaded.
<br>This keeps the data bandwidth as low as possible.
<br>
<br>RadioSkyPipe example data files:
<br>LOCAL: workspace/rsp/localdatabackup.spd
<br>REMOTE: localdatabackup.spd (When configured to use Martyn Kinder's FTP server)
<br>
<br>JohnCook example data files:
<br>LOCAL: workspace/johncook/20050531.dat
<br>REMOTE: n/a
<br>
<br>You can display any files you have previously downloaded by providing a path to the file,
<br>based on 'dist' as the working directory.
<br>
<br>It is possible to use other data formats by changing the DataTranslator setup.
<br>Refer to Starbase customer support for assistance!
<br>
<br>
<br><b>RadioSkyPipe Configuration</b>
<br>
<br>Starbase can *only* recognise RSP format files when they are configured as:
<br>
<br>Double=false        (i.e. uses Integers)
<br>UT=true             (Universal Time)
<br>Timestamped=true    (Each data sample has a date and time)
<br>
<br>The other items of RSP configuration (LatLong, titles etc.) will appear as chart labels
<br>or in the configuration tab.
<br>
<br>You may also wish to add an item of metadata so that the control panel will show the
<br>frequency of operation automatically.
<br>Just add the following line to the RSP metadata (changing the frequency appropriately):
<br>
<br><b>Observation.Channel.Value.Virtual.0=21.4kHz</b>
<br>
