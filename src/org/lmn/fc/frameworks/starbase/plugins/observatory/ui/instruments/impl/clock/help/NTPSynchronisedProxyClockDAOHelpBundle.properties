getSynchronisePeriod=Get the current period between automatic synchronisations of the Observatory Clock. The value will be in the range 10 to 1000 seconds. This value is reset to 10 seconds following the execution of <b>Core.reset(Defaults)</b>.
setSynchronisePeriod=Set the period between automatic synchronisations of the Observatory Clock with network time. Bear in mind that a shorter period, although giving greater short-term accuracy, will generate more network traffic and load the NTP time servers. The value is constrained by the Regex in the Instrument XML to be between 10 and 1000 seconds. If you need to use values outside of this range, you will need to edit the instrument XML accordingly.
synchroniseTimeProxy=Synchronise the Observatory Clock Proxy using NTP, if possible with the current configuration, otherwise do nothing. The Time Proxy is under development, and may not always be accurate.
getNtpDatagram=Get a single NTP datagram, detailing the time information from the NTP server, and the offset from the local Observatory Clock.
exportClockOffset=Export the chart showing the offset of the Observatory Clock from network time, as an image in PNG, JPG or GIF formats.
getDate=Get the Date from the Observatory Clock, in the format yyyy-mm-dd (ISO 8601).
getTime=Get the Time from the Observatory Clock, in the format hh:mm:ss (ISO 8601).
getTimeZone=Get the TimeZone from the Observatory Clock, in the format GMT+00:00, giving the number of hours offset from GMT (+/-).
calculateToposEphemeris=Calculates an Ephemeris based on the Observatory location (if available) for the specified target, between the given dates and times. You can vary the time interval between output points, from 1 to 20000 seconds. The generated Ephemeris will appear on the Ephemeris tab, and may be saved using the Exporter.
synchroniseNow=Synchronise the Observatory Clock using e.g. NTP, if it is possible with the current configuration (i.e. set up to use a Time Proxy), otherwise do nothing.
