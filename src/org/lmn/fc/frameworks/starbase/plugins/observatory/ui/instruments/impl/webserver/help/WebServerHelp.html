<h3>Starbase WebServer</h3>

<br><br>Starbase has a simple embedded webserver, to allow direct publication of observations from any Instrument.

<br><br>You may connect to the webserver's index page using any browser,
by going to URL <b>http://localhost:8080/index.html</b>

<br><br>Other Instruments may publish their results to this server, using commands like <i>publishResults()</i>

<br><br>If you want to experiment, go to installation_path/webroot and modify the index.html file.

<br><br>BEWARE! This 'tiny browser' only supports HTML v3.2, which isn't very clever!

<br><br>For information about the webserver, see <a href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/">http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/</a>

<br><br>Note that the Starbase browser currently does not have a 'Back' button, so if you go off to Jetty
the only way back is to stop and restart the server!
