# Monitor
monitorCommands=Start or stop the Command monitor. All commands executed anywhere in the Observatory will be logged. Note that this may use a considerable amount of memory, and the facility is intended only as a debugging aid.
monitorPorts=Start or stop the Port monitor. All messages sent to all Ports in the Observatory (e.g. Staribus, COM, Ethernet) will be logged. Note that this may use a considerable amount of memory, and the facility is intended only as a debugging aid.
monitorMemory=Start or stop the Memory monitor. The memory used by the system is plotted on a chart every 30 seconds. This is a useful way to monitor how memory is consumed during long downloads or large imports. The Java Garbage Collector activity can also be monitored.
enableJavaConsole=This command redirects the standard input and output from Java to the Java Console tab. For instance on Windows the DOS console will stop showing messages and they will appear in the tab. The whole session may then be exported for later analysis and debugging.

exportCommandMonitor=Exports the contents of the Command Monitor tab in a variety of file formats.
exportPortMonitor=Exports the contents of the Port Monitor tab in a variety of file formats.
exportMemoryMonitor=Exports the contents of the Memory Monitor tab as an image in a variety of file formats.
exportActions=Exports the contents of the Actions tab in a variety of file formats. The Actions are a list of issues which were detected at runtime, which should ideally be dealt with by the user either changing some configuration, or perhaps by reporting a fault.
exportJavaConsole=Exports the contents of the Java Console tab in a variety of file formats.
exportObservatoryLog=Exports the contents of the Observatory Log tab in a variety of file formats. The ObservatoryLog is a combination of all other EventLogs in the system.
