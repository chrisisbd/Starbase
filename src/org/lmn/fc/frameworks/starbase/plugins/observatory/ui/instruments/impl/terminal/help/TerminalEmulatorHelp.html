<title>Starbase Terminal Emulator</title>
<body>
<h3>Starbase Terminal Emulator</h3>

<br>
<br>This is a very simple Terminal Emulator, intended for debugging Instruments using RS232/485
<br>
<br>The communication parameters are set in TerminalEmulator-properties.xml
<br>
<br><b>Note that it is not possible to send just a CR:</b>
<br>
<br>User types LF (ctrl-J)  Terminal sends CR (ctrl-M) followed by LF (ctrl-J)
<br>
<br>User types CR (ctrl-M)  Terminal sends CR (ctrl-M) followed by LF (ctrl-J)
<br>
<br>i.e. they both produce the <b>same</b> output.
<br>This is due to a limitation in Java,
<br>which cannot read the CR key independently of the LF key.
<br>It is unlikely that this limitation will cause problems,
<br>but you need to be aware of it.
<br>Windows and Linux handle CR/LF differently,
<br>and this feature should make the differences less apparent.
<br>
<br>If you find a device which does not function correctly, please let us know.
