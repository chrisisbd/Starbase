<B><P>Installation:</P>
</B><P>Careful consideration should be given to the location of the magnetometer, as there are many sources of magnetic disturbance and interference in most domestic situations. Using the default gain setting, an indoor location in a spare room or loft space should be suitable. Higher gain settings may well require an outdoor location, well away from roads, vehicles and other ferrous objects that may move. The movement of any ferrous object (such as a steel bodied car) will alter the local magnetic field, and therefore be detected by the magnetometer. Some experimentation may well be required. In practise, the Earth's natural magnetic field will move slowly compared with 'domestic' objects, and so such interference is easily seen and rejected from the recordings.</P>
<P>If the full 2-axis magnetometer is to be used, it must be aligned in 3-dimensions with the local magnetic field. This must be done in a way that holds the sensor rigidly in place, and prevents any movement. If a single axis is required, then the magnetometer can be put on a flat surface and rotated to simply point at magnetic north. The 4 alignment lamps should help in this process, correct orientation being when all 4 lamps are at a minimum brightness.</P>
<P>It is worth spending some time with the magnetometer held in the hand to see how the alignment lamps work. If the direction of north is not known, then identify it with an ordinary magnetic compass. With the magnetometer powered up, start by rotating it in a horizontal plane such that the alignment lamps face north. At some point the left &amp; right lamps will swap, indicating magnetic north. Careful fine adjustment should result in left &amp; right lamps at a minimum. If both lamps remain bright together, then there may be a local interfering magnetic field (such as from a mains transformer). Such a site would not be suitable for the magnetometer. The magnetometer can now be tilted (north end upwards) so that the local field becomes normal to the sensor. The up &amp; down lamps will now swap, the null position of minimum brightness again being the correct point. Having established this orientation, a means of fixing the magnetometer in space can be devised.</P>
<B><P>Results:</P>
</B><P>Recordings made over a 24 hour period should show the diurnal variation due to the earth's rotation. The magnetosphere is pushed away by the solar wind, and so the field direction appears to sway from side to side each day. When the sun is quiet, this effect is easily seen. On top of this slow variation, there are likely to be steps recorded, due to local 'domestic' interference. Steel garage doors and moving vehicles are most likely to be recorded.</P>
<P>Turbulence in the solar wind will buffet the magnetosphere, and so be recorded as a disturbance to the local magnetic field. These disturbances are often larger than the diurnal variation, and occur over much shorter periods. The disturbance may last less than an hour, or continue for longer. The amplitude recorded will depend on the degree of turbulence in the solar wind; a major coronal mass ejection may well saturate the sensor at times of high solar activity.</P>
<P>While smaller (minor) disturbances are quite common, even at times of low solar activity, major disturbances can be used to warn of possible auroral conditions. If there has been a significant particle injection into the magnetosphere then an aurora may become visible as the auroral oval moves in our direction.</P>
