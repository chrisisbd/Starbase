<h3>Starbase Starcam</h3>

<br>The Ethernet Webcam used to test the operation of Starcam was a D-Link DCS-900.
<br>Note that this camera has a built-in webserver, so Starbase requests the image with HTTP.
<br>If you use a different type of camera it may not be possible to import the image into Starbase.
<br>Please ask for support on starbase@ukraa.com **before** purchasing your camera!
<br>See: http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=270
