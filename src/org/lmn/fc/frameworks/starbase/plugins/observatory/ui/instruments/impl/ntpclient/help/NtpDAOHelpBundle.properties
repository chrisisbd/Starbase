getNtpDatagram=Get a single NTP datagram, which will return the detailed time information from the NTP server, and the offset <b>between NTP and the Observatory Clock, NOT the local computer clock</b>. You may optionally synchronise the ObservatoryClock, <b>but only if it is currently configured for this operation</b> (i.e. set up to use a Time Proxy). UK users should use the Pool Servers wherever possible, and these are set as default in the NTP properties XML file.
captureClockOffset=Captures multiple NTP datagrams, using the specified time interval, for the specified period (0 means continuous operation), in order to build up a plot of offsets <b>between NTP and the local computer clock, NOT the Observatory Clock</b>. From this you can estimate the drift rate of the host computer, and make adjustments if necessary. If the Observatory Clock Time Proxy is currently running, this should show a similar chart of offsets as the Synchroniser Chart on the Observatory Clock.
exportClockOffset=Export the chart showing the offset of the Observatory Clock from network time, as an image in PNG, JPG or GIF formats.
getDate=Get the Date from the Observatory Clock, in the format yyyy-mm-dd (ISO 8601).
getTime=Get the Time from the Observatory Clock, in the format hh:mm:ss (ISO 8601).
getTimeZone=Get the TimeZone from the Observatory Clock, in the format GMT+00:00, giving the number of hours offset from GMT (+/-).
