<h3>Starbase Monitor</h3>

<br>
<br><b>Command Logger Tab</b>
<br>

<br><b>Port Monitor Tab</b>
<br>
<br>The log shows an index number and the Date and Time of the Port event
<br>The Port originating the event (e.g. Staribus, SpectraCyber)
<br>The Stream is either Tx (transmit, sent from the PC) or Rx (receive, arrives at the PC)
<br>Traffic indicates the bytes sent over the channel, with control characters expanded
<br>The Hex column shows the stream traffic as a series of Hex bytes
<br>StarScript is the scripting language statement executed by the command, or the name of the response variable
<br>The Response Value is the data returned by the remote device
<br>The Units refer to the response value (e.g. mV, Celsius)
<br>DataType refers to the response value (e.g. DecimalByte, Float, Date)
<br>The Response Status is the 16 bit field of status information. All zero means 'success'.
<br>The Status Codes show the text mnemonic corresponding to the bits in the status field
<br>
<br><b>Memory Usage Tab</b>
<br>
<br>The Memory Usage chart show the amount of memory used by Starbase as a function of time,
<br>while the Observatory Monitor is running.
<br>The memory allocated to Starbase is set on the java command line in the batch file/shell script
<br>and is set by default to 512Mb.
<br>You may run the Java 'Garbage Collector' at any time, by clicking the wastebin next to the
<br>memory usage status indicator. This will force all unused memory to be released.
