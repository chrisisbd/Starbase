getInterpretedNMEA=Show those NMEA sentences which should be available from the GPS receiver hardware in order to generate the most accurate information. The GPS instrument will still function if some sentences are not generated, but some information will be missing. It may be necessary to manually configure your GPS receiver to generate the correct sentences.
getGpsFix=Read the latest information from the GPS receiver hardware in order to produce a fix. You may view the positions of the satellites on the Satellite Map tab. If you set this command to repeat, then the tracks of the satellites are shown on the Satellite Map. The calculated centroid of these fixes is added to the Metadata, giving a more accurate position as more fixes are taken. You may optionally update the Framework and/or Observatory locations, either using the calculated centroid position, or an instantaneous single fix. The current implementation does not average the HASL value, it always uses the latest reading.
captureScatterPlot=Captures multiple GPS fixes, using the specified time interval, for the specified period (0 means continuous operation), in order to build up a scatter plot of locations. The centroid of this plot may be used as a more accurate location for Framework or Observatory updates.  You may optionally update the Framework and/or Observatory locations, either using the calculated centroid position, or an instantaneous single fix. The current implementation does not average the HASL value, it always uses the latest reading.
exportSatelliteMap=Exports the contents of the Satellite Map tab as an image in a variety of file formats.
exportScatterPlot=Exports the contents of the Scatter Plot tab as an image in a variety of file formats.
exportGpsFixes=Exports the contents of the GPS Fixes tab in a variety of file formats. Note that even if the current view is truncated the export will still contain the entire dataset.
