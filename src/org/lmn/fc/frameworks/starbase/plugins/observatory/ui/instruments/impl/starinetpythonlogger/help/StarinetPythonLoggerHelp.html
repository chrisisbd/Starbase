<h3>Starbase Starinet Python Logger</h3>

<h3>Publisher Module</h3>

<br>The publisher command uploads a chart of the current dataset held on the controller to an FTP site of your choice.
<br>
<br>To enable the publisher function of the controller use the setPublisher command found in the capture module.
<br>You first need to set the upload interval within the range of 5 to 60 minutes, next set the target host address
<br>plus user name, password and the remote folder you which to upload the generated image too.  You can see the current
<br>settings using the getPublisher command.
<br>
<br>The publisher function of the controller can generate either one of the below two types of chart, combined and
<br>stacked respectively.

<br>
<br>The charts can be customised to some extent using the setPublisherArtist and setPublisherLabels
<br>commands available in the publisher module.  Use the setPublisherArtist to change the type of chart and to enable or
<br>disable the individual channels.  Use the setPublisherLabels to set the labels for each channel expect temperature.
<br>
<h3>Controller Hardware and Code</h3>

<br>The controller code was developed in Python 2.7 on a Beaglebone Black Rev B microcontroller.
<br>
<br>The controller code is free to use and modify and is available from http://github.com/Starbase/
