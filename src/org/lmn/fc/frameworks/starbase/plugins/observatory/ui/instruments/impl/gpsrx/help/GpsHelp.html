<title>Starbase GPS Receiver</title>
<body>
<h3>Starbase GPS Receiver</h3>
<br>
<hr>
<br> The GPS Receiver interprets the NMEA 0183 standard protocol, used by most GPS receivers to transmit data.
<br> NMEA output is EIA-422A but for most purposes you can consider it RS-232 compatible.
<br> Use 4800 bps, 8 data bits, no parity and one stop bit (8N1).
<br> NMEA 0183 sentences are all ASCII. Each sentence begins with a dollar sign ($)
<br> and ends with a carriage return linefeed (CR LF).
<br> Data are comma delimited. All commas must be included as they act as markers.
<br> Some GPS receivers do not send some of the fields.
<br> A checksum is optionally added (in a few cases it is mandatory).
<br> Following the $ is the address field aaccc.
<br> aa is the device id. Transmission of the device ID is usually optional.
<br> 'GP' is used to identify GPS data.
<br> 'ccc' is the sentence formatter, otherwise known as the sentence name.
<br>
<br> e.g. The Garmin GPS35-PC unit produces the following NMEA sentences:
<br>
<br>  $GPGGA  Global Positioning System Fix Data
<br>  $GPGSA  GPS DOP and Active Satellites
<br>  $GPRMC  Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data
<br>  $GPGSV  GPS Satellites in view
<br>
<hr>
<br> To run the GPS Receiver, first select the GPS module.
<br>
<br> Use the <b>getInterpretedNMEA()</b> command to see which NMEA sentences are currently supported by Starbase.
<br> This information is stored in Starbase, <b>NOT in the GPS receiver itself</b>.
<br> (If some sentences are not supplied, then it may still be possible to obtain some useful information.)
<br>
<br> To obtain the latest position from the GPS Receiver, execute the <b>getGpsFix()</b> command.
<br>
<br> To capture repeated fixes and produce a scatter plot of the results, execute the <b>captureScatterPlot()</b> command.
<br> This command will calculate the centroid of the accumulated fixes, or just use the latest fix.
<br> It is possible to choose to update the location of the Framework, the Observatory, or both.
<br>
<br> Look in the <b>InstrumentLog</b> tab to see the detailed GPS information returned by the receiver.
<br> Look in the <b>EventLog</b> tab to see if there are any warnings about missing or invalid data.
<br> (It may be possible to configure your receiver to produce the required NMEA sentences.)
<br>
<br> The <b>SatelliteLocations</b> tab will show all currently visible satellites
<br> on an Elevation-Azimuth projection. It will also show the position of the Sun and other objects.
<br> To clear the satellite tracks and start again, execute the <b>reset()</b> command.
<br>
<br>    Zoom In
<br>        Left_click zooms in
<br>        Shift-left_click zooms to the full extents of the display
<br>        Left_click in lower left corner (also) zooms to full extents
<br>
<br>    Zoom Out
<br>        Right_click zooms out
<br>        Shift-right_click zooms to the full extents of the display
<br>
<br>    Properties
<br>        Control-right_click looks for the nearest object and shows a properties box
<br>
<br>    <i>Reserved
<br>        Control-left_click moves the cursor in tracking mode (not implemented yet)</i>
