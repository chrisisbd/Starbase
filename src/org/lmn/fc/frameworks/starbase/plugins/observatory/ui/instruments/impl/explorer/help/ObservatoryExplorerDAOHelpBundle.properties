uploadOS=This command uploads an Intel HEX format file containing the Operating System to the specified Controller target device, provided the Controller is in <b>bootloader mode</b>. You may optionally select to fill the unused part of the code memory with 0xff (256 decimal); this will take longer to upload. For Starinet Ethernet devices,Starbase and the controller must be on the <b>same</b> network for this to work; it is not possible to upload to a remote device over the external Internet.
getNetworkInterfaces=This command returns a list of the network interfaces available on the host computer, which may be useful when setting up the Starinet network.
