getTemperature=Get the temperature of the VLF plugin or Controller module.
getRealtimeData=Return the current value of the data taken from the controller analogue to digital converters (ADC). These data are indicated on the instrument's control panel in the rack, and are available via the instrument metadata.

# SignalProcessor
# Note these should be kept in step with the Starinet equivalents
runOscillator=Run or stop the VLF oscillator, currently only as FreeRun, and later a Sweep mode will be implemented.
measureFrequencyResponse=Use this command with a Controller with an Analogue converter facility. Connect the SignalProcessor Oscillator output to the input of a VLF Receiver (via a suitable attenuator), and the receiver output to the Controller's A2D Channel 0. When the parameters are adjusted correctly, the Chart will show the frequency response of the receiver, which may be useful when tuning. This measurement method is sometimes known as a 'wobbulator'. The command repeatedly executes: <br>SignalProcessor.setOscillatorFrequency(Frequency)<br>Utilities.wait(Sweep.DwellTime)<br>Analogue.getA2D(A2D.Channel)
configureOscillator=Configure the VLF oscillator in one command. Encoding is fixed at LinearPCM. BitsPerSample are fixed at 16. Channels are fixed at 2.
setWaveformType=Set the type of waveform produced by the VLF oscillator: Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth, Random, GaussianNoise.
setWaveformSampleRate=Set the sample rate of the waveform produced by the VLF oscillator. The user must bear in mind the capabilities of the audio hardware installed, and the Nyquist sampling limitations.
setOscillatorFrequency=Set the frequency of the waveform produced by the VLF oscillator. The user must bear in mind the capabilities of the audio hardware installed, and the Nyquist sampling limitations.
setOscillatorAmplitude=Set the amplitude of the waveform produced by the VLF oscillator as 0.00 to 99.9%.
playAudioFile=Play an audio file from the local file system in any format supported by your sound hardware.
importAudioFile=**Under Development** Import an audio file from the local file system, into the RawData.
