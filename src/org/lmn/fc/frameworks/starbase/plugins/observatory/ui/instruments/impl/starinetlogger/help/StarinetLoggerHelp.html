<h3>Starbase Starinet Logger</h3>

<h3>Uploading a new Controller Operating System</h3>
Go to the Manager Group tab, and execute the following command:
<br>
<br><b>ObservatoryExplorer.Explorer.uploadOS()</b>
<br>
<br>You will need the latest Starinet-Nanode HEX file from the downloads at
<br>http://www.ukraa.com/beta/nightly-builds/Starinet.
<br>Remember to set the Controller into <b>Bootloader mode</b> before using this command.
<br>Hold down the bootloader button, then press reset. Then release both buttons.
<br>The LED should blink with a different pattern to show that the mode has changed.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Scanning for Starinet compatible devices on the local intranet</h3>
Go to the Manager Group tab, and select the ObservatoryExplorer.
<br>Click on the Starinet Scanner tab, and enter the required range of IP addresses.
<br>Any correctly working Starinet devices will respond with their host name.
<br>In the current implementation of Starbase, you may need to manually edit
<br>the <b>IPAddress</b> field in the Instrument XML file in order to use the discovered IP address,
<br>and restart the Observatory. Work is in progress to simplify this procedure.
<br>Note that this facility does <b>not</b> work in the public Internet,
<br>in fact such scanning might be regarded as a criminal act!
