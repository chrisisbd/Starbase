Changes in current build:

Framework and Infrastructure

The Framework About 'box' now has an Acknowledgements tab detailing the many third-party libraries used in the software.

There is a new user login named builder, with a user Role of Builder,for those users who wish to rebuild everything from scratch.

DataTypes, Metadata, POI, LOI - The internal implementation of DataTypes, Metadata, PointsOfInterest and LinesOfInterest have all been significantly changed.

-----------
Observatory

Toolbars - Several Toolbars have been improved.

Charts - The performance and operation of the charting facility has been improved, with the addition of a simple slider to allow selection of a range of data.

Data Filters - The data filters have been completely rewritten, to make addition of new filters much simpler: the LinearTransform function is now implemented as a filter.

Digital Panel Meter Tab - All logger instruments which can display numeric data now have a Digital Panel Meter tab, with one meter for each data channel.

Distinction between Capture and Import - Part of the improvements in Metadata handling resulted in a clearer distinction between the action of Capturing data (for instance from a logger), and of Importing data, (for instance from a local file).

Sandbox Instrument - A new instrument called the 'Sandbox' has been added, as a general-purpose testbed.

SpectrumLab Support - SpectrumLab CSV files may now be imported up to a maximum of 32 channels, provided that the correct metadata appear at the start of the file.

Observatory Clock - The Ephemeris can now be driven directly by metadata.

Communicator - Information tabs have been added to Communicator to give RSS newsfeeds.

GPS Receiver - The GPS Receiver and Simulated GPS Receiver now have a ScatterPlot tab, which can accumulate GPS fixes over a long period of time.

Magnetometer - The main changes to the Magnetometer relate to the distinction between Capture and Import of data.

VLF Receiver - The main changes to the VLF Receiver relate to the distinction between Capture and Import of data.
